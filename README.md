# REMEMBERMate
Mobile Dev - Project Finals

This application is about a flashcard and reminder built into one. Currently, it is still in the works, as I am still learning how to code using Java in Android Studio.
My friends or my barkada specifically recommended me to use Flutter. But, I think I'll try to commit using Java.
